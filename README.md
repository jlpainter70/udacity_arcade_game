Description
Welcome to my variation of the classic arcade game, Frogger.  Based on the content and characters of the game, I have renamed it "Dodge Bug".  Below are instructions and bugs in the game.

Download Instructions
You can clone or download the "Dodge Bug" game at the following Github URL, https://github.com/jlpainter70/udacity_arcade_game.

Gameplay Instructions
Open the html file, and the game will load in your browser.  Instructions for play are on the initial start modal.  If you need to see the inital start modal, just refresh your browser.  The game is pretty straight forward.  Just move the sprite character to the water until you score 50 points.  You have 3 lives to complete the task.  Good Luck!!!

Known Bugs
You will notice the bugs run at variable speeds.  In order to get new speeds to load, you must refresh the browser.
When the player reaches 50 points, the winner modal will not appear until the player is either hit by a bug, or reaches the water again.
The initial score are start is blank.  Once the program resets or restarts, it will show Score: 0.
